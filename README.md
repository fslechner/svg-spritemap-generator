# An SVG-Spritemap-Generator

Based on [SVG Spritemap Webpack Plugin](https://github.com/cascornelissen/svg-spritemap-webpack-plugin) and [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack)

**Generate SVG-Spritemaps of your desired SVG-Icons**

Use your own created SVG-Icons or icons of one of the SVG-Icon-Sets linked below. But use exactly those icons you need for your Project combined in one spritemap.

1. Put your \*.svg icons into src/icons folder.
2. Execute yarn start or npm (run) start.
3. Use the generated spritemap.svg in the dist folder.

It is recommended to use same sized icons and scale them via css!
